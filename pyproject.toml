# This file configures wheels compilation for `cibuilwheel` for SimSIMD CPython bindings.
# On a good day it will produce:
#   - `manylinux` and `musllinux` wheels for Linux on x86_64, aarch64, i686, ppc64le, s390x;
#   - `macos` wheels for x86_64, arm64, and universal2;
#   - `windows` wheels for AMD64, x86, and ARM64.
#   * for Python versions from 3.6 to 3.12.
#   * running thousands of fuzzy tests on each wheel.
#   = meaning 16 platforms * 7 Python versions = 112 builds.
